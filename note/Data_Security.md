## Levels of Data Access
#### organization,Objects,Fields,Records
#### As with role hierarchies, sharing rules can never be stricter than your org-wide default settings. They just allow greater access for particular users.
### four record-level security controls.
##### Org-wide defaults specify the default level of access users have to each other’s records
##### Role hierarchies ensure managers have access to the same records as their subordinates. Each role in the hierarchy represents a level of data access that a user or group of users needs
##### Sharing rules are automatic exceptions to org-wide defaults for particular groups of users, to give them access to records they don’t own or can’t normally see
##### Manual sharing lets record owners give read and edit permissions to users who might not have access to the record any other way.
